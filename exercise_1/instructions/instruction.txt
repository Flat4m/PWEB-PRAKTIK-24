Blog Creation Challenge: Basic HTML Website

Objective:
Create a simple, static blog website using HTML5. The site should have a clean, readable layout and use semantic HTML tags appropriately.
--------
Requirements:
1. HTML File:
Create a single HTML file named blog.html.
2. Page Structure:
Use the HTML5 doctype.
Your page should include the following semantic elements: <header>, <footer>, <main>, and <article> tags.
3. Header:
The <header> should contain the title of your blog and a brief introduction or tagline.
4. Main Content Area:
Use the <main> tag to enclose the blog content.
Inside <main>, include at least two <article> elements representing individual blog posts.
5. Each <article> should have:
A headline wrapped in an <h2> tag.
A publication date in a <p> tag.
A main content paragraph.
A figure with an image and a <figcaption>. Ensure images have appropriate alt text.
6. List:
Include at least one unordered (<ul>) or ordered (<ol>) list in one of the articles, summarizing key points or topics covered in the blog post.
7. Footer:
The <footer> should contain copyright information.
8. Style (Optional):
While CSS styling is not required, you may add a simple internal or external stylesheet to improve the visual layout.
9. Images:
Source at least two images relevant to your blog content. These should be used within your <figure> elements.
